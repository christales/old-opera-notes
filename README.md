old-opera-notes
===============

An attempt to re-create the old Opera Notes panel in HTML5 and JavaScript.

Clicking on the + button or focusing the bottom box (when it's empty) will start a new note. The note is saved on each keyUp event. To delete a note, select it from the list and press *Delete*.

Uses code example from <https://github.com/curtislacy/inject-sidebar> - many thanks!

You can try the [packaged extension](https://github.com/coreymwamba/old-opera-notes/old-opera-notes.nex) if you wish, but it's not verified!!
