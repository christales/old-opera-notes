old-opera-notes
===============

An attempt to re-create the old Opera Notes panel in HTML5 and JavaScript.

Clicking on the "add note" button or focusing the bottom box (when it's empty) will start a new note. The note is saved on each keyUp 
event. To delete a note, select it and then click the "delete note button".
