old-opera-notes
===============

An attempt to re-create the old Opera Notes panel in HTML and JavaScript. It doesn't do everything as it's very simple; but how complicated should notes be?

Clicking on the *Add* button or focusing the bottom box (when it's empty) will start a new note. The note is saved on each keyUp event. To delete a note, select it from the list and press the *Delete* button.

You can also select text in a web page and copy it to a note from the context menu.

Uses icons from [PICOL](http://www.picol.org).

You can try the [packaged extension](https://github.com/coreymwamba/old-opera-notes/blob/master/old-opera-notes.nex) if you wish, but it's not verified!! "View Raw" to install, I think.
