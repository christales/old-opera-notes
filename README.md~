===============

A simple note panel in HTML and JavaScript - includes a "copy to note" context menu item as well.

Use the Add Note icon - or click inside the lower text box - to add a new note. Notes are saved as you type.

Delete a note by selecting it in the list and clicking the Delete icon.

You can also copy text from a web page to a note (but you will need to close the panel: am trying to fix this!)

Open source icons from [PICOL](http://www.picol.org).
